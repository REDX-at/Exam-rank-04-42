The Microshell project is part of the Exam 04 series at 1337 (42 Network). This project challenges students to implement a simplified version of a Unix shell, focusing on process management, pipes, and basic shell functionality. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in C programming and gain a deep understanding of how shells handle commands, file descriptors, and process execution.

## Introduction
The Microshell is a smaller, custom version of a Unix shell that mimics the behavior of common shell operations. It is designed to help students master the fundamentals of Unix-like operating systems, process control, and inter-process communication using pipes.

## Key Concepts
1. Command Execution
Learn how to execute commands by forking processes and replacing them with new programs using execve. Understand how shells interpret commands and run them in a controlled environment.

### 2. Input/Output Redirection
Handle standard input/output redirection using file descriptors. Master the use of dup2 to redirect input and output between processes and files.

### 3. Pipes and Inter-Process Communication
Learn how to implement pipes to allow communication between multiple processes. Understand how shells use pipes to pass the output of one command as the input of another.

### 4. Process Management
Handle the lifecycle of processes, including creation with fork, synchronization using wait, and managing process termination.

### 5. Error Handling and Edge Cases
Understand how to detect and handle errors during process execution, redirection, and piping. Manage edge cases like invalid commands or file permissions effectively.

Features
Shell Simulation: Simulate a basic Unix shell that can execute commands and manage pipes.
Process Control: Use fork, execve, and wait to control the execution of multiple processes.
Pipes and Redirection: Implement piping and redirection to allow communication between commands.
Error Handling: Robust error detection and handling for invalid commands, permissions, and system errors.
